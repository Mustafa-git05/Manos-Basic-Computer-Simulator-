# Manos-Basic-Computer-Simulator-
Cycle-accurate simulator for Mano’s Basic Computer. Loads programs and data from text files into simulated memory and supports step-by-step execution at cycle or instruction level. Fully models the CPU datapath, implements all Mano instructions, and includes CLI debugging and performance profiling (cycles, CPI, memory access).
